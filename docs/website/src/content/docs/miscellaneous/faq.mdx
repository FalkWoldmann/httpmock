### Can I start multiple mock servers in one Rust test function?
Yes, you can start multiple mock servers. However, `httpmock` uses a server pool with a default limit of 25
servers. You can adjust this limit by setting the `HTTPMOCK_MAX_SERVERS` environment variable.

### In which order are mocks evaluated?
When the `httpmock` server receives a request that matches multiple mocks, they are evaluated in
reverse order of their definition. This means the most recently defined mock takes precedence and will be used.
