title: Request Matchers
description: Using request matchers to specify which requests should respond. TODO
---

This section describes matcher functions designed to target and match the scheme in incoming HTTP requests
(such as `http` or `https` as in `https://localhost:8080`).

These matchers are especially useful when using the proxy and record-and-playback features of `httpmock`.
