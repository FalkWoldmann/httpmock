## Version 0.5.0
- ‚ùå _**Breaking Change**_: Function `Mock::expect_json_body` was renamed to `expect_json_body_obj`.
- ‚ùå _**Breaking Change**_: Function `Mock::return_json_body` was renamed to `return_json_body_obj`.
- üöÄ _**Attention**: A new API for mock definition was added. The old API is still available. No changes required on your side!_

    - `Mock::expect_json_body`
    - `Mock::return_json_body`
    - `When::json_body`
    - `Then::json_body`
- Improved documentation (a lot!).

- Support for convenient temporary and permanent redirect.
- The log level of some log messages was changed from `debug` to `trace` to make debugging easier.
